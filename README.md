# RecallShield

**RecallShield** is a lightweight Windows application designed to **block Microsoft's Recall feature** and **prevent unauthorized screen captures** to protect your privacy.

With the introduction of automatic screenshotting mechanisms like Recall, privacy concerns are at an all-time high. RecallShield gives you back control by stopping background screen logging and ensuring your digital workspace remains private.
